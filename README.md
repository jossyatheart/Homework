### ORDERED LIST:

 Steps on how to cook rice in markdown format:
1. Boil water and add salt:
      After you rinse your rice, pour fresh water (for  every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a  tight-fitting lid.
1. Pour in rice. 
     * Add the rice to the boiling water.
2. Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice.

   Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.
 
3. Cover the pot and simmer.
    * Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.
7. Fluff rice with a fork.

##### MAKE SOME TEXT WITH BOLD, ITALIC AND BOLD-ITALIC FORMATED FONTS:

<b>What Is Markdown?</b><br />
<i>Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.</i><br />

<b><i>Why Use Markdown?<br />
It’s Easy to Learn and Fast to Use.
Markdown is dead simple to learn. The official syntax can be found here, but most of what you’ll need to know is that typing *word* will make it bold, typing **word** or _word_ will italicize the word, links are written like this [anchor text](http://www.URL.com), and lists are written exactly how you’d expect: just hit enter and add any of these three characters at the start of each line: -, *, +. So this:</B></i><br />
